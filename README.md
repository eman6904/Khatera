# Khatera - "خاطرة!" ✨

**Khatera** is an updated version of the old **Note App**, which was originally built using **XML** and some **Firebase services**.

The main goals of developing **Khatera** were:

1. **Integrate Jetpack Compose with XML** in the same project, enabling faster and more modern updates for legacy apps.
2. **Add Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to experiment with sending notifications to users, either via Firebase Console or backend.

The app was rebuilt with a **clean and organized structure**, fixing previous issues and improving **Fragment Lifecycle handling** to ensure stable UI and smooth data reception.

---

## 🔹 Features

- Share any "Khatera" (note) with all users and send instant notifications.
- Hybrid design combining **Compose and XML** for easier future enhancements.
- **Clean Architecture** for maintainable and scalable code.

---

## 🔹 Technologies

- Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, XML
- Firebase (Auth, Database, Storage, FCM)
- Android Lifecycle & Fragments
